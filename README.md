# nRF5 SDK for Eddystoneâ„¢

This is an example implementation of the Eddystone GATT Configuration Service for nRF52. Support for nRF51 is scheduled for a future release. The application is intended to be used together with the open source [nRF Beacon for Eddystone](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Beacon-for-Eddystone) Android App. It is recommended to read the [official specification](https://github.com/google/eddystone) for Eddystone, an open beacon format from Google to get a thorough understanding. Go to [Quick start](#quick-start) if you want to experiment right away.

## Introduction
The new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service enables simple configuration of beacons. The user can configure the beacon to broadcast all Eddystone frame types:
* Eddystone-URL
* Eddystone-UID
* Eddystone-EID
* Eddystone-TLM
* Eddystone-eTLM

Each frame type is given a dedicated slot and it is possible to set unique advertising intervals for each slot. This means that a beacon can send a Eddystone-URL every two seconds and a Eddystone-UID every second or any other combination. The current firmware has a lower limit of 100ms for advertising interval. It will be up to the user or developer to choose values that best fit with the use case and desired power consumption.

In addition to the new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service there are also two new frame types aimed at secure use cases.

The new frame types are **Eddystone-EID** and **Eddystone-eTLM**. EID, or Ephemeral Identifier, is a secure version of UID. eTLM, or encrypted TLM, is a secure telemetry format and provides information on the health of a beacon.

Eddystone-EID and Eddystone-eTLM protect against spoofing, replay attacks and malicious asset tracking - which are known beacon vulnerabilities.

#### Spoofing
Beacon spoofing is pretending to be a beacon. With regular beacons it is possible for someone to hijack the advertising data, which is always the same, and connect it to their own app. This could for instance enable an app for company A to serve information when a user is near a beacon for company B.

This is impossible with Eddystone-EID since the advertising data is encrypted and regularly updated.

#### Replay Attacks
If a beacon is unlocked with a fixed value it is possible to listen to the radio communication between a phone and a beacon and record the unlock value. A malicious user could now replay this unlock value to the beacon and gain configuration access.

By randomizing and never sending the Unlock Key in clear text it is impossible to perform replay attacks with the new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service. The beacon creates a random challenge token every time a user tries to unlock it. The user then encrypts the Lock Key with the challenge token and sends the result to the beacon. The result will be different for every unlock and replay attacks are therefore impossible.

Unauthorized authentication
Unauthorized authentication could allow someone to connect to and configure a beacon. This way company A could simply reconfigure a beacon owned by company B to advertise company A data.

The new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service is locked down by default. In order to configure the beacon a user must write a Lock Key to the Unlock Characteristic. The Lock Key is unique to each beacon and it will not be possible to remotely reconfigure the beacon without the Lock Key. Note that the Lock Key is encrypted with a random challenge token before it is sent.

#### Malicious Asset Tracking
If a beacon is attached to a bus it could be possible to track the location of the beacon and therefore the bus. This is especially true if the beacon is always advertising the same data.

Eddystone-EID randomizes the device ID of the beacon as well as the encrypted advertising data. Since there are no constant values to track it will be difficult if not impossible to track the location of a single beacon over any significant time period.

> **IMPORTANT**
A beacon should only be configured as Eddystone-EID and Eddystone-eTLM slots in order to have all the security benefits. A beacon configured as both Eddystone-EID and Eddystone-UID would still be vulnerable to tracking.

## Requirements

#### Software
* [nRF5 SDK 11](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF5_SDK_v11.x.x/)

The application might work with other versions of the SDK but some modification of the source code is likely required on your part.

#### Hardware
* [nRF52 Development Kit](https://octopart.com/nrf52-dk-nordic+semiconductor-67145952)

## How to install
#### Quick Start
This is the recommended approach if you just want to get started quickly without building the project yourself.

1. Connect the nRF52 DK to your computer. It will show up as a JLINK USB drive.

2. Download the `nrf5_sdk_for_eddystone.hex` file in the hex folder in this repository.

3. Drag and drop the `nrf5_sdk_for_eddystone.hex` file on the JLINK drive to automatically program the nRF52 DK.

4. Install the nRF Beacon for Eddystone Android App from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.nrfbeacon.nearby).

5. Follow the [instructions on how to use the App](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Beacon-for-Eddystone).

#### Compile from source
1. Download the [nRF5 Software Development Kit v11](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF5_SDK_v11.x.x/) and extract to a suitable location. We recommend placing it close to root to avoid problems related to long folder and file names.

2. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone.git
```

3. Copy the `nrf5_sdk_for_eddystone` folder and place it next to the other folders in the nRF5 SDK v11 `ble_peripheral folder`.
```
examples
        ble_peripheral
                ble_app_alert_notification
                ble_app_ancs_c
                ble_app_beacon
                ....
                nrf_sdk_for_eddystone
```

4. Run the script to clone and configure third-party cryptographic libraries.
```
>> crypto_setup.bat (windows)
or
>> crypto_setup.sh (linux)
```

## How to use
After flashing the firmware to a nRF52 DK it will automatically start broadcasting a Eddystone-URL pointing to http://www.nordicsemi.com. In order to configure the beacon to broadcast a different URL or a different frame type it is necessary to put the DK in configuration mode and write the Lock Key to the Unlock Characteristic. This is done by using the nRF Beacon for Eddystone App.

Detailed instructions on how to use the App is available in the [nRF Beacon for Eddystone GitHub repository](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Beacon-for-Eddystone).

## Issues and support
This example application is provided as a source code foundation for beacon providers or for users simply wanting to experiment with Eddystone. It is not part of the official nRF SDK and support is therefore limited. Expect limited follow-up of issues.

## Cryptographic libraries
The example application uses algorithms from the following third-party cryptographic libraries.

## About
This application has been developed by the application team at Nordic Semiconductor as a demonstration of the Eddystone GATT Configuration Service. It has not necessarily been thoroughly tested, so there might be unknown issues. It is hence provided as-is, without any warranty. However, in the hope that it still may be useful also for others than the ones we initially wrote it for, we've chosen to distribute it here on GitHub. The application is built to be used with the official nRF5 SDK, that can be downloaded from http://developer.nordicsemi.com/.
