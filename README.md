# nRF5 SDK for Eddystoneâ„¢

This is an example implementation of the Eddystone Configuration Service for nRF52. Support for nRF51 is scheduled for a future release. It is recommended to read the [official specification](https://github.com/google/eddystone) for Eddystone, an open beacon format from Google.

This application is intended to be used together with the open source **nRF Beacon for Eddystone** Android App.

## Introduction
The application supports all Eddystone frame types:
* URL
* UID
* EID
* TLM
* eTLM

The application supports all functionality of the Eddystone Configuration Service except the advanced optional characteristics as displayed in the table below.

Characteristic | Name | Status
---:|---|---
1 | Broadcast Capabilities | :white_check_mark:
2 | Active Slot | :white_check_mark:
3 | Advertising Interval | :white_check_mark:
4 | Radio Tx Power | :white_check_mark:
5 | Advertised Tx Power (advanced) |
6 | Lock State | :white_check_mark:
7 | Unlock | :white_check_mark:

9 | EID Identity Key | :white_check_mark:
10 | ADV Slot | :white_check_mark:
11 | Factory Reset (advanced) |
12 | Remain Connectable (advanced) |


## Requirements

#### Software
* [nRF5 SDK 11](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF5_SDK_v11.x.x/)

The application might work with other versions of the SDK but some modification of the source code is likely required on your part.

#### Hardware
* [nRF52 Development Kit](https://octopart.com/nrf52-dk-nordic+semiconductor-67145952)

## How to install
#### Quick Start
1. Connect the nRF52 DK to your computer. It will show up as a JLINK drive.
2. Download the hex file in the hex folder in this repository.
3. Drag and drop the hex file to the JLINK drive. The device will be flashed.
4. Install the XXXX Android app from Play Store.
5. Press Button 1 on the nRF52 DK

#### Compile from source
1. Download the nRF5 SDK 11 and extract to a suitable location. On Windows we recommend placing it close to (C:) to avoid long folder and file name problems.
2. Download and extract this repository
3. Copy the nrf5_eddystone_sdk folder and place it next to the other folders in the nRF5 SDK 11 ble_peripheral folder.
## How to use
After flashing the firmware to a nRF52 DK it will automatically start broadcasting a Eddystone-URL pointing to this repository. In order to configure the beacon to broadcast a different URL or a different frame type it is necessary to put the DK in configuration mode and write the Lock Key to the Unlock Characteristic. Download and install the



## How it works

## Documentation

## Issues and support
This example application is provided as a source code foundation for beacon providers or for users simply wanting to experiment with Eddystone. It is not part of the official nRF SDK and support is therefore limited. Expect limited follow-up of issues.

## Cryptographic libraries
The example application uses algorithms from the following third-party cryptographic libraries.

## About
This application has been developed by the application team at Nordic Semiconductor as a demonstration of the Eddystone Configuration Service. It has not necessarily been thoroughly tested, so there might be unknown issues. It is hence provided as-is, without any warranty. However, in the hope that it still may be useful also for others than the ones we initially wrote it for, we've chosen to distribute it here on GitHub. The application is built to be used with the official nRF5 SDK, that can be downloaded from http://developer.nordicsemi.com/.

## Licenses
The nRF5 SDK for Eddystone licensing is split between the portion of the source code that
originates from Nordic Semiconductor ASA and the
portion that originates from third-parties.

* All source code contained under the following folders originates from Nordic
  Semiconductor and is covered by the license present
  in documentation/license.txt in the nRF5 SDK:

    - components
    - examples
    - SVD

* All source code contained under the following folder originates from third
  parties, and is covered by the corresponding licenses found in each of their
  respective subfolders:

    - crypto_libs

* The crypto_libs folder is created by running the crypto_libs.bat program.
