# nRF5 SDK for Eddystoneâ„¢

This is an example implementation of the Eddystone GATT Configuration Service for nRF52. Support for nRF51 is scheduled for a future release. The application is intended to be used together with the open source [nRF Beacon for Eddystone](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Beacon-for-Eddystone) Android App. It is recommended to read the [official specification](https://github.com/google/eddystone) for Eddystone, an open beacon format from Google to get a thorough understanding. Go to [Quick start](#quick-start) if you want to experiment right away.

## Release note
* __v0.7.1__ (may 4 2016)
    * __NEW!__ Support for SEGGER Embedded Studio, a cross-platform firmware IDE for OSX, Windows and Linux! Great for developers who do not own a Keil license or is developing on OSX/Linux.

* __v0.7__ (April 29 2016)

    * Added persistent slot configurations feature so that after power loss or intentional reset of the chip, all previously configured slots will be restored from flash memory. Note that in order for slots to be saved to flash memory, a BLE Disconnect event must occur before any accidental or intentional power loss.
    * EID clock values are now written to flash memory every 24 hours as recommended by Google's [spec](https://github.com/google/eddystone/blob/master/eddystone-eid/eid-computation.md) for recovering from power loss regarding EID computation.
    * Merged in via script the cifra crypto library's fix for a [known issue](https://github.com/ctz/cifra/issues/3) with EAX encryption of the eTLM frames. Now eTLM frames are properly encrypted. Make sure to run `crypto_setup_all.sh` so the correct commits are checked out.
    * Added a stand-alone application hex file without the softdevice merged in so it can be DFUed with a bootloader.
    * Other small stability improvements, bug fixes, and house cleaning.
    * Updated README with [How it works](#how-it-works) section explaining the different modules in the firmware.


* __v0.6__ (April 21 2016)
    * Revamped folder structures and project setup procedure to allow for better user setup experience. Namely the downloading of SDK via scripts. Details described below in [How to install](#how-to-install).
    * ~~Merged in cifra crypto library's fix for a [known issue](https://github.com/ctz/cifra/issues/3) with EAX encryption of the eTLM frames. Now eTLM frames are properly encrypted.~~
    * Fixed a bug with the EID slot 4-byte clock being slow.
    * Added scan response capability when the beacon is put into connectable mode which contains `nRF5_Eddy` as the device name and the Eddystone Configuration GATT Service UUID `a3c87500-8ed3-4bdf-8a39-a01bebede295` as the UUID in the scan response packet, as recommended by the latest [spec](https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/configuration-service) from Google.
    * Improved LED Indication for different beacon states: Advertising, Advertising in connectable mode, Connected. Details below in [How to use](#how-to-use).
    * Improved connection stability with "Error 133" commonly seen on Samsungs by adding the Peripheral Preferred Connection Parameters characteristic

* __v0.5__ (April 15 2016)
    * First public release


## Introduction
The new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service enables simple configuration of beacons. The user can configure the beacon to broadcast all Eddystone frame types:
* Eddystone-URL
* Eddystone-UID
* Eddystone-EID
* Eddystone-TLM
* Eddystone-eTLM

Currently the firmware has five available slots and each slot can be configured to any of the unique frame types. From the source code it is possible to increase or decrease the number of available slots.

In addition to the new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service there are also two new frame types aimed at secure use cases.

The new frame types are **Eddystone-EID** and **Eddystone-eTLM**. EID, or Ephemeral Identifier, is a secure version of UID. eTLM, or encrypted TLM, is a secure telemetry format and provides information on the health of a beacon.

Eddystone-EID and Eddystone-eTLM protect against spoofing, replay attacks and malicious asset tracking - which are known beacon vulnerabilities.

#### Spoofing
Impersonating Eddystone-EIDs is difficult since the advertising data is encrypted and regularly updated.

#### Replay Attacks
By randomizing and never sending the Unlock Key in clear text it is difficult to perform replay attacks with the new Eddystone GATT Configuration Service. The beacon creates a random challenge token every time a user tries to unlock it. The user then encrypts the Lock Key with the challenge token and sends the result to the beacon. The result will be different for every unlock and replay attacks are therefore impossible.

#### Malicious Asset Tracking
Eddystone-EIDs randomize the device ID of the beacon as well as the encrypted advertising data. Since there are no constant values to track it will be difficult if not impossible to track the location of a single beacon over any significant time period.

> **IMPORTANT**
 In order to have all the security benefits of Eddystone-EID and Eddystone-eTLM refrain from configuring other non-secure frame types while broadcasting these secure frame types

## Prerequisites

#### Software
* [Keil uVision 5 IDE](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm) (Note: you must have a registered version of Keil in order to compile source code that generates more than 32kB of code and data, currently this project generates 39 kB even with -O3 optimization level).
* [SEGGER Embedded Studio IDE](https://www.segger.com/downloads/embeddedstudio) with the [nRF](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/attachment/315266173907f1c16d81f842f0796730) and CMSIS packs installed. (Note: If you don't have a Keil license or you are developing on Mac OS X or Linux this is the best option).
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* [nRFgo Studio](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRFgo-Studio/nRFgo-Studio-Win64/14964) (Note: Not required if using SEGGER Embedded Studio).

The application might work with other versions of the SDK/Keil but some modification of the source code is likely required on your part. For a quick start on using Embedded Studio with nRF5 devices see: https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/blogs/845/segger-embedded-studio-cross-platform-ide-w-no-cod/.

#### Hardware
* [nRF52 Development Kit](https://octopart.com/nrf52-dk-nordic+semiconductor-67145952)
* Android phone 4.3+

## Known issues
* IAR and GCC Makefile based projects are scheduled for a future release.
* When compiling in Keil (ARMCC) there are warnings from the third-party crypto libraries.

## How to install
#### Quick start
This is the recommended approach if you just want to get started quickly without building the project yourself.

*  Connect the nRF52 DK to your computer. It will show up as a JLINK USB drive.

*  Download the `nrf5_sdk_for_eddystone_v0.7.hex` file in the hex folder in this repository.

*  Drag and drop the `nrf5_sdk_for_eddystone_v0.7.hex` file on the JLINK drive to automatically program the nRF52 DK.

*  Install the nRF Beacon for Eddystone Android App from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.nrfbeacon.nearby).

*  Follow the [instructions on how to use the App](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Beacon-for-Eddystone).

#### Compile from source

*  Clone this repository into your preferred location (keep it close to root to avoid path too long problem on Windows, because the SDK will be downloaded via a script into the same parent directory as well)
```
git clone https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone.git
```
* In the `nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone\setup_scripts` folder, you will find several bash/batch scripts that will help you set up the repository with the necessary components in order for Keil to compile the project. The 2 scripts that are of interest to the user are `download_sdk_setup.sh` and `existing_sdk_setup.sh`:
    *  Run the `download_sdk_setup.sh` script if you don't already have `nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197`. This script will automatically download the required nRF5 SDK into the parent folder ( so that `nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197` lives right next to `nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone`), create necessary symlinks into the SDK for Keil to find the required components, and also clone the required third party crypto libraries from Github.
    * If you already have `nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197` on your machine, then simply open `existing_sdk_setup.sh` in your favourite text editor and edit the line
    ```
    export SDK_PATH=""
    ```
    and fill in the absolute path to your existing SDK folder, as such:
    ```
    e.g. SDK_PATH="C:/example_path/nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197"
    ```
    then save it and run the script. It will do the same things as the `download_sdk_setup.sh`, except not downloading the SDK of course.

* If everything goes smoothly, you should find the following additional components in the `nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone`, indicated with ** :
```
Some_parent_folder
        nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197 (would be here if you ran download_sdk_setup.sh)
        nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone
                                bsp
                                hex
                                include
                                project
                              **sdk_components
                              **sdk_external
                                setup_scripts
                                source
                                     ble_services
                                   **crypto_libs
                                     modules
                                .gitignore
                                licenses.txt
                                README.md
```

#### Keil
*  Open the .uvprojx project file in Keil, which is found here:
```
nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone\project\pca10040_s132\arm5_no_packs
```
*  The project is expected to compile with 2 warnings coming from one of the crypto libraries when using Keil. You might also need to download NordicSemiconductor::nRF_DeviceFamilyPack 8.5.0 in Keil's Pack Installer if you don't already have it before the project can compile.
*  Before loading the firmware onto your nRF52 DK or starting a debug session in Keil, you must flash in the S132 Softdevice that can be found here:
```
sdk_components\softdevice\s132\hex\s132_nrf52_2.0.0_softdevice.hex
```
The Softdevice can be flashed in with Nordic's [nRFgo Studio](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRFgo-Studio/nRFgo-Studio-Win64/14964) tool. For instructions on how to use nRFgo Studio, follow the tutorial here under the [Preparing the Development Kit](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/2/) section.

#### SEGGER Embedded Studio
*  Open the .emProject project file in SEGGER Embedded Studio, which is found here:
```
nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone\project\pca10040_s132\embedded_studio
```
*  Build and run/debug the project.

## How to use
After flashing the firmware to a nRF52 DK it will automatically start broadcasting a Eddystone-URL pointing to http://www.nordicsemi.com, with LED 1 blinking. In order to configure the beacon to broadcast a different URL or a different frame type it is necessary to put the DK in configuration mode by pressing Button 1 on the DK so it starts advertising in "Connectable Mode". After that, it can be connected to nRF Beacon for Eddystone app, which allows the writing of the Lock Key to the Unlock Characteristic.

Please note that after pressing Button 1, the DK will only broadcast in "Connectable Mode" for 1 minute. After which, you must press Button 1 again if you did not manage to connect in time with the App.

###### LED Indications:
| LED No.       | LED State       | Beacon State  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| LED 1     | Blinking | Advertising |
| LED 2        | On      |   Connected to Central |
| LED 3 | On     |    Advertising in Connectable Mode |

Detailed instructions on how to use the App is available in the [nRF Beacon for Eddystone GitHub repository](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Beacon-for-Eddystone).

## How it works
### Modules
The firmware is mainly broken up in several modules that each handle specific functionalities required by the Eddystone specification.
* **eddystone_ble_handler**
    * Here is where the BLE functionalities are initialized along with all the other modules in the firmware. It's essentially the practical main file of the project.
    * In `services_and_modules_init` you can see how the broadcast capabilities are set via the `ble_ecs_init_params_t` struct and can change the defined macros (prefixed with `APP_`) accordingly in `eddystone_app_config.h` to reflect your needs.
    * The module is also responsible for handling all BLE events coming from the softdevice and dispatching them to the other modules that need them.
    * Most importantly this module controls all the R/W authorizations of the Eddystone Configuration GATT Service. Any characteristic R/W events coming from the Central is handled here in `ecs_read_evt_handler()` and `ecs_write_evt_handler()` so the correct per slot information and security information can be accessed in the `eddystone_adv_slot` and `eddystone_security` modules before R/W of the characteristic values.


* **eddystone_adv_slot**
    * This module is the data core of the firmware which contains all the data (non-security related) in the slots with which the BLE Central interact.

    Essentially this module contains an array of `eddystone_adv_slot_t` structures, with each structure representing a slot: parameters such as the advertising interval and radio tx power are written to and retrieved from here, and it's also responsible for formating and keeping the data of the actual frames (`adv_frame` member of the struct) to be broadcast (which are retrieved and advertised by the `eddystone_advertising_manager`) or to be read from R/W ADV Slot characteristic. The exception is for TLMs/eTLMs which is generated in real-time by `eddystone_tlm_manager`'s `eddystone_tlm_manager_tlm_get()`/`eddystone_tlm_manager_etlm_get()`every time the `eddystone_advertising_manager` needs to broadcast a TLM/eTLM and the advertised packet is copied back into the slot's `adv_frame` via a pointer so that when the user reads it in characteristic 10, the last advertised packet will be displayed.


* **eddystone_security**
    * The security module does exactly what it sounds like it does, security. All the encryption/decryption processes such as validating the unlock key, generating and exchanging ECDH keys, eTLM encryption etc. are handled here here and it acts as an abstraction layer to the 3rd party crypto libraries that we use. Similar to `eddystone_adv_slot`, the security module contains an array of `eddystone_security_slot_t` structures that contain all the necessary data to maintain an EID.
    * One notable function that might be of interest for developers is `eddystone_security_lock_code_init()` since it determines how the lock code it generated.
        * Since the lock code is suppose to be an unique 16-byte value for any device, one way is to use the `DEVICEID` register of the `FICR` to get 8 bytes of unique value, then it's up to the developer to implement how the other 8 bytes are created.
        * For easier debugging and development purposes, there is currently an `STATIC_LOCK_CODE` definition which hard-codes the lock key to all 0xFFs.


* **eddystone_flash**
  * The flash module is an abstraction of the SDKs `pstorage` library and it organizes the flash blocks (32 byte each) nicely to fit the persistent data needs of Eddystone specifically. This module is used by `eddystone_adv_slot` to preserve and restore slot configurations between reboots, and used by `eddystone_security` to store the lock key and EID information. Check out the corresponding structures in the firmware to see how the data fields in each block are populated.

###### Flash blocks arragemnet

| Block No.       | Data Type      | Corresponding Structure |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 0     | Slot Configuration | `eddystone_flash_slot_config_t` |
| 1,2,3...        | Slot Configuration |  `eddystone_flash_slot_config_t` |
| APP_MAX_ADV_SLOTS - 1 | Slot Configuration |  `eddystone_flash_slot_config_t` |
| APP_MAX_ADV_SLOTS | Private ECDH Key |  32 byte array |
| APP_MAX_ADV_SLOTS + 1 | Public ECDH Key |  32 byte array |
| APP_MAX_ADV_SLOTS + 2 | Lock Key | 16 byte array |
| APP_MAX_ADV_SLOTS + 3 | Flash Flags | `eddystone_flash_flags_t` |


* **eddystone_advertising_manager**
 * The advertising manager module manages the retrieval of advertising data from `eddystone_adv_slot`and adjusts the advertising intervals provided by the user to fit the capabilities of the hardware (esp. for eTLM encryption) before broadcasting the data. Read the comments inside `intervals_calculate()` to see the details of how advertising interval limits are handled and how you as a developer can tweak this to fit your needs.
 * Currently the advertising manager is set up to implement global advertising intervals only, but it can be adapted with some work to implement variable advertising interval by modifying how the timers behave in the module. The key function to note is `fetch_adv_data_from_slot` which gets the data from the `eddystone_adv_slot` module in the proper format and puts it into `ble_advdata_set`.


* **eddystone_registration_ui**
 * A simple `app_button` implementation that triggers a callback into `eddystone_advertising_manager` when `BUTTON_1` is pressed in order to go into connectable mode advertising for registration and configuration of the beacon. This module can easily
 be modified to use another type of HW UI such as NFC, as long as a callback is made to `eddystone_advertising_manager` when the user action is detected.

* **eddystone_tlm_manager**
 * Module for computing the TLM frame in real-time whenever it is required by `eddystone_advertising_manager`. Currently it has no implementation of battery voltage sampling but it can be added by the developer by using the on-chip ADC and some wiring in the DK.

### User Configs
 Inside `project\pca10040_s132\config` you can find `debug_config.h` and `eddystone_app_config.h` which are useful for changing the debug and application behaviour respectively. Read the comments in those files for details.



## Issues and support
This example application is provided as a firmware foundation for beacon providers or for users simply wanting to experiment with Eddystone. It is not part of the official nRF5 SDK and support is therefore limited. Expect limited follow-up of issues.
